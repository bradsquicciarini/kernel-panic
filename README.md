## Current Status

Collision detection between "players" (aka two pink cubes) and the main platform in the y direction

## What needs to be done 

I think it would be sick if we eventually made the stage look like Corneria. We could definitely make it look 
really good with texture mapping and such.

However, for right now, I think this would be the best order of progression:

* [x] Gravity and collision detection with main platform
* [x] Movement control for players
* [x] Collision detection for all platforms in y directions
* [ ] Collision detection in x direction 
* [ ] Add a melee and projectile attack for players
* [ ] Draw players. (This would include arms that move for strikes. Scene graphs?) 
* [ ] Add background, texture mapping to platforms (Make it look pretty)
* [ ] Make Corneria!!!!
