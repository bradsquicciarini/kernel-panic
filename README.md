## Current Status

Collision detection between "players" (aka two pink cubes) and the main platform in the y direction

## What needs to be done 

I think it would be sick if we eventually made the stage look like Corneria. We could definitely make it look 
really good with texture mapping and such, but for right now I think this would be the best order of progression:

* [ ] Collision detection for all platforms in all directions (x and y)
* [ ] Movement control for players
* [ ] Add a melee and projectile attack for players* [ ] Add background
* [ ] Draw players. (This would include arms that move for strikes. Scene graphs?) 
* [ ] Add background, texture mapping to platforms (Make it look pretty)
* [ ] Make Corneria!!!!

Just suggestions! Not strict guidelines.
